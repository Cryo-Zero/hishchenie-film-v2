# HISHCHENIE / THEFT — visual system contract

This document defines the active visual/composition laws of the project. It is **not** a list of arbitrary CSS values and it is **not** a backlog.

Use it together with:

- `PROJECT-STATE.md` — what is true now;
- `DECISIONS.md` — accepted long-term rules/reasons;
- `BACKLOG.md` — ideas that may be revisited, not implementation approval.

Before visual/responsive work, read this file first.

## 1. World field / world grid / сетка мира

`World field`, `world grid`, `сетка мира`, `поле мира` describe the shared composition system of the site. This is not merely one `margin`, `max-width` or CSS variable.

On desktop, most scenes intentionally share composition offsets from the viewport, left/right visual boundaries, top/bottom reference lines, visual ceilings, cross-scene alignment lines, internal rhythm and controlled empty space.

The goal is that separate sections feel like different states of one system/world.

Do not change one desktop scene's geometry in isolation without checking how it relates to the other scenes. Do not mechanically stretch approved desktop scenes to `width:100%` merely because space exists.

## 2. World grid is a contract, not a cage

The world grid is the default visual contract, not an absolute prohibition.

### Intentional exceptions / explicit creative direction

If the owner explicitly approves a scene-specific direction that requires taking an element outside the world field, making a scene wider than the grid, breaking standard margins, crossing normal alignment lines or creating a deliberate visual exception, that direction is allowed and takes priority over the general grid rule for that scene.

A deliberate local exception is not automatically a layout bug. It must remain local and must not casually destroy the global system of the other scenes.

Historically important example: **Materials / Archive**. The desired Archive composition previously suffered when it was forced too strictly inside the common grid. Do not repeat that mistake. If explicit creative direction says to leave the grid, leaving the grid is allowed.

Current runtime reinforces this: the Archive control is intentionally tied to the physical viewport wall while the Materials scene is active.

## 3. Navigation = scenes / tabs

The primary navigation — О ФИЛЬМЕ, МАТЕРИАЛЫ, ТРЕЙЛЕР, ГДЕ ПОСМОТРЕТЬ, АКТЁРЫ, ОТЗЫВЫ, FAQ — must be understood as navigation between scene-like compositions/states, not simply anchors in a generic stacked landing page.

Preserve the feeling of moving between system screens/tabs. Do not automatically convert the whole site into a conventional long vertical landing page.

## 4. Desktop = visual reference, not fixed canvas

The approved desktop is the primary visual reference. It defines composition intent, hierarchy, atmosphere, world/system language, interaction character and functional meaning.

It does **not** mean that one specific owner monitor resolution is a fixed canvas that every device must reproduce 1:1. Absolute coordinates and exact geometry may adapt when the viewport requires it.

If viewport height allows, a scene may read as a complete screen. On low-height desktop/laptop viewports, normal document flow is acceptable. Do not crop content or shrink the interface to unreadability merely to preserve an artificial one-screen/100vh composition.

## 5. Responsive philosophy / device matrix

Responsive work is not only `PC` versus `mobile`.

At minimum consider:

- wide desktop;
- normal desktop;
- small desktop;
- low-height laptop;
- MacBook-class laptop;
- portrait desktop monitor;
- tablet landscape;
- tablet portrait;
- phone portrait;
- phone landscape.

Layout decisions should consider the combination of viewport width, viewport height, aspect ratio, orientation, pointer type, hover capability, touch capability, `dvh`/`svh` behavior, safe-area insets, browser chrome, Retina/HiDPI, OS/browser scaling and browser zoom.

Android/iOS/Windows/macOS matter because browser/platform behavior differs, but OS name alone must not decide the layout.

## 6. Portrait desktop ≠ phone

`height > width` is not sufficient reason to activate a phone layout.

A large portrait monitor with mouse/hover and large physical area remains a desktop context. It should receive an adapted desktop visual, not automatically a phone composition.

## 7. Tablets

A tablet is not automatically a large phone.

- Tablet landscape should preserve the desktop experience as closely as practical, or fully, when space allows.
- Tablet portrait may use stronger structural adaptation.

## 8. Phone version is an interpretation

Phone layouts must not literally compress complex desktop scenes into ~390–430 px.

Allowed adaptations include different layout, sequential presentation, vertical flow, fullscreen/sub-scenes, reordering blocks, different navigation interaction, simplified decorative geometry, reduced/simplified nonessential animation, touch alternatives to hover and reducing the amount of information visible simultaneously.

Priority order for a phone interpretation:

1. functionality;
2. meaning;
3. visual identity;
4. hierarchy;
5. atmosphere;
6. interaction character;
7. composition intent;
8. literal geometric similarity.

## 9. First responsive/mobile release

The first responsive/mobile pass is primarily for making the whole site usable from a phone, including the client/film team viewing it normally.

The first pass does not need to be pixel-perfect.

Priority:

- the whole site is reachable;
- scenes do not collapse;
- text remains readable;
- touch controls work;
- navigation/menu works;
- trailer, materials, actors, reviews, FAQ and profile remain accessible;
- the distinctive site character is preserved as far as practical.

Fine spacing/cosmetic polish may be a separate later pass.

## 10. Actors contract

Current runtime confirms the Actors scene uses a bespoke `SUBJECT DOSSIER` model.

Preserve these principles:

- compact subject selection;
- selected-subject highlight;
- the selection list must not jump/change geometry when a subject is selected;
- a persistent detail/dossier area receives the selected subject;
- the information area remains part of the scene rather than disappearing randomly;
- system identity uses subject/number/role language;
- `SUBJECT // UNIDENTIFIED` and `???` are valid neutral/default states;
- staged/bespoke reveal animation is part of the scene identity.

Do not automatically turn Actors into a generic card grid.

On phone, sequential `subject selection → dossier/detail` is an allowed interpretation, but the exact composition is not approved until owner review.

## 11. FAQ contract

FAQ uses its own `SYSTEM QUERY` presentation and staged response behavior. This system/query character and animation are part of the visual identity.

The desktop multi-zone presentation does not have to remain simultaneous on a phone.

### Approved responsive FAQ direction — 2026-09-10

The owner approved the following **composition direction** for the responsive FAQ. This is approved design direction, not proof that a future implementation is correct; final acceptance still requires actual browser rendering.

- **Phone portrait:** sequential scene model `QUERY INDEX → SYSTEM RESPONSE`.
- **Phone landscape:** use the same sequential interaction model instead of switching back to desktop merely because width is larger; low viewport height is a primary constraint.
- **Tablet portrait:** use the same sequential interpretation as the default starting direction, with more breathing room where available.
- **Tablet landscape:** preserve the current two-zone `QUERY LIST | SYSTEM RESPONSE` composition when real fit/render remains usable.
- **Desktop, including portrait desktop context:** preserve the approved two-zone console model unless a separate viewport-specific problem is proven.

For sequential phone/tablet-portrait behavior:

- entering a question changes the FAQ scene state rather than expanding a generic accordion row;
- keep `QUERY_xx`, selected state, `SYSTEM RESPONSE`, status/source/message/system-log language, neutral `QUERY_00 // STANDBY`, close/back behavior and staged reveal character;
- provide a clear return path such as `QUERY INDEX` / equivalent back control;
- the response should replace/succeed the index within the FAQ scene rather than forcing the visitor to scroll past the full question list to find a response panel below it;
- phone rotation must not arbitrarily change the conceptual interaction model from sequential to desktop; actual height/aspect/input capability must be considered;
- do not present this as a modal/generic accordion unless a later explicit owner decision chooses such a variation.

The exact micro-layout, spacing, typography, animation timing and final responsive implementation remain subject to visual/browser QA. The approved principle is the scene-state relationship above.

## 12. Archive / Materials contract

Archive / Materials is a deliberate exception to the default world grid when needed.

Preserve bespoke archive layout, drawer/viewer character, bespoke transition/animation behavior and the ability for explicit creative direction to take the composition outside the normal world field.

Do not classify intentional overflow/alignment exceptions as bugs merely because they differ from the default grid.

## 13. Reviews / profile contract

Reviews/profile are functionally denser than the film scenes but must remain visually part of the same system/world language. Do not automatically restyle them as a generic dashboard/web app.

Current public sorting contract: New / Old / Popular.

Do not restore old public filters without new approval, including all, team reply or low/high rating.

The R6 profile-help UI is an overlay over the composer and must remain overlay-like; it must not create layout reflow that breaks the scene geometry.

Phone adaptation must prioritize readability, touch, composer usability, rating, sorting, replies and profile-help access while preserving the system language.

## 14. Interaction / touch

Important functionality cannot depend on hover alone.

Touch contexts need a clear equivalent for any important hover interaction. Interactive controls need usable hit areas.

Potential future improvements such as burger/navigation refinements, larger gallery/pagination hit targets, vertically centered arrows and review-tab touch polish belong in `BACKLOG.md` until explicitly approved.

## 15. Hero / trailer historical decision

Current runtime uses a **static first-screen poster**. The trailer is a separate `SIGNAL` scene with its own video preview/player.

A previous looped/autoplay trailer fragment on the first screen was tried and rejected.

Approved current direction:

- keep the first screen static/poster-based;
- keep trailer preview/playback in the trailer scene;
- do not restore autoplay/looped hero video without a new explicit decision.

## 16. Rejected redesigns

P20 / P21 / P22 are rejected historical redesign attempts.

They are not current design, not approved alternatives and not a source of automatic tasks.

Their historical preservation is intentional: an individual old idea may be reconsidered or restored if it later becomes useful to the project, but only after new explicit owner review/approval. Rejected history is therefore not a permanent ban and not automatic implementation permission.

## 17. Responsive design approval evidence

For substantial responsive reinterpretations, approve the intended visual composition before final implementation whenever practical.

Keep two evidence classes separate:

- **Concept / mockup / prototype** — communicates the intended design direction.
- **Actual browser render** — confirms how the real implementation behaves at a real viewport/device context.

A proposed concept is **not approved design** until the owner explicitly approves it. Concept approval is permission to implement that direction, not proof that implementation is correct.

Final responsive acceptance must be based on actual browser rendering. Do not treat a mockup, source inspection or verbal plan as equivalent to a verified browser result.

If rendering evidence is unavailable, report the limitation explicitly and keep the implementation status `NOT VERIFIED` where appropriate.

Reference viewport sizes such as `390×844`, `844×390`, `430×932`, `932×430`, `768×1024`, `1024×768`, `1366×768` and `1080×1920` are **design/test references**, not hardcoded breakpoint requirements.

## 18. How to resolve visual conflicts

Visual work follows this priority:

`current explicit owner instruction`

→ `approved scene/task-specific decision`

→ `current VISUAL-SYSTEM contract`

→ `historical decision/context`

→ `BACKLOG idea`

A newer explicit owner direction may intentionally override a more general older rule. BACKLOG never authorizes implementation.
